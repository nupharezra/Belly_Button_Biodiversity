# Belly_Button_Biodiversity

## Purpose

Create a dashboard to display bacterial data for those who volunteered. On the dashboard, the demographic data for each volunteer is displayed, as well as data reflected in a bar chart, bubble chart and gauge chart. Each chart reflects data specific to the volunteer ID chosen from the dropdown menu.
